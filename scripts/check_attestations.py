"""Check that every distribution in a directory (default dist/) has a non-empty
PEP 740 publish attestation beside it, as astral-sh/attest-action writes them:
`<file>.publish.attestation`.

uv publish uploads a file's attestation if it finds one and quietly uploads the
file without one if not, so the publish jobs run this between attest-action and
uv publish, to stop rather than publish a release with no provenance. The
Attestations workflow runs it on PRs that could break that, without uploading.

Prints a GitHub Actions ::error:: line for each problem, which also reads fine
outside Actions."""
