"""Wait for a PR's base commit to have its coverage report on Codecov.

Codecov compares a PR's coverage against its base commit's report, and works
out that comparison (and sets its statuses) only when the PR's own upload is
processed; it never revisits it when the base's report turns up later. So when
a PR's CI runs alongside its base's (e.g. a PR brought up to date with master
just as master's own run starts), the PR's upload can land first and get
"Please upload report for BASE", and has to be re-run.

CI's ``coverage`` job runs this on PRs just before uploading coverage. It polls
Codecov's API for the base commit's totals and returns as soon as they're
there, which is the first request unless the base's CI is still running. Until
then it checks the base's latest ``coverage`` check run on GitHub: once that
has succeeded (or if there is none), Codecov gets ``--grace`` seconds to
process the upload before this gives up, and if it failed, was cancelled or was
skipped, no report is coming, so it gives up straight away.

It never fails the job: giving up (then, after ``--grace``, or after
``--timeout`` in all) prints a GitHub Actions warning and exits 0, as the
base's CI failing (e.g. master is broken and this PR fixes it) mustn't fail the
PR's own job. Codecov's ``if_not_found: failure`` (codecov.yml) then fails
``codecov/project``.

Ported from skissane/taxtracker. Standard library only; run it as a module
(``python -m scripts.wait_for_base_coverage``) from the repo root.
